The way this works is by subjectification. When you have a strong emotion about something, you experience that emotion as the product of your own personality. You are less likely to take it for granted as an objective truth. You are more likely to see it for what it is, a subjective emotional response.

This means you wonâ€™t be doing as much projecting. Rather than believing that the world is colored in the way that your value judgments tend to color it, you will now be able to distinguish better between the world as you perceive it and the world as it really is. This is not to say that you will have some greater knowledge of objective truth, but rather that you will have a greater skepticism with regard to your own value judgments. Instead of being inherent in things, you will realize that they are more so inherent in your own personality.

This means that you take ownership of your emotions. Instead of blaming your emotional responses on other people, you recognize them as your own. Instead of viewing yourself as being triggered by external factors, you realize that you are the one pulling the trigger.

What exactly am I saying here? I am saying that we constantly project our value judgments onto the world around us. When we love someone, we think of them as lovely. When we hate someone, we think of them as hateful. When we are bored with something, we think that it is boring. When we see a painting that we like, we think of it as beautiful. As we move through life, we are constantly painting the world around us with our value judgments. And so we live in a world and experience the world as a place in which those value judgments are welded into the very external reality around us. We don't perceive these feelings as coming from within. We perceive them as bound together with the things without.

When we meditate, we spend a lot of time with our eyes closed, or maybe open just a little bit gazing at something neutral, just watching the currents of the mind as they ebb and flow, surge and swirl around. We watch these value judgment percolate up and bubble around and subside. We get familiar with our own inner patters. We experience the activity of our own inner judgments even while we are sitting still and quiet and nothing much is going on.

And so, when we get up from the cushion and go out into the world, we remain aware of our inner value judgments as inner value judgments, rather than as qualities inherent to things that are being judged. This is a bit paradoxical, because it's almost like there are two different processes running in the mind at the same time. There is the process of making the value judgment, and there is the process of observing the value judgment as a subjective event. And it is this second process, which through meditation becomes increasing automatic and persistent, which interferes with the first process. So that the value judgment we are making stutters and softens even as we are making it.
