## Introduction: A Quick Primer on Meditation

There are many benefits to the practice of meditation. These include reduced reactivity, better social relationships, a reduced risk of accidents, reduced stress, better time management, better concentration and learning, a greater enjoyment of life, and improved confidence. In this book, I discuss each of these benefits at some length. I talk about how meditation brings them about and how much time and effort are needed to start experiencing them. The bottom line is, for most people, meditation is a very worthwhile endeavor. It is one of the best things a person can do for their wellness and general happiness.


### What is meditation?

Simply put, meditation is focusing in the mind. You bring the mind to concentrate on some particular object, and then you keep it there.

Usually, the meditation object is the breath. By this I mean the physical sensations associated with breathing. Some prefer to focus on the rising and falling of the belly. Other concentrate on the flow of air past the nostrils. Either way, the mind is centered on a particular physical sensation associated with breathing, and it rests there.

It may help to count your breaths. Breath in and out. That's the first count. Breath in and out again. That's two. And so on, all the way up to 10. Then start over. You are not trying to count to some astronomical number.


### Is meditation difficult?

Meditation is not difficult. The vast majority of people find, however, that keeping the mind on the breath for any length of time is impossible. This is entirely normal and expected. Most people are unable to keep their attention on the breath.

Nevertheless, meditation is not that hard. The beginning practitioner is not expected to focus on the breath for their entire session. They are only expected to try. Maybe they get a few seconds of focus here or there. Even those few seconds are valuable.

In addition, those few seconds of focus are not the only aspect of the exercise that are valuable. The rest of the time is valuable, too. It is important to experience what your mind is like when it is restless and wandering around and doesn't have a compelling task to work on. For this reason, all of the time spent meditating is useful and instructive, even when it may seem a little absurd.

Some people may find the mind-wandering that occurs when they try to meditate to be uncomfortable. They get caught up in their worries and fears. They feel their anxiety level rising. They feel uneasy and find the ordeal unpleasant. And so they discontinue their practice.

There are a few of ways to try to address this problem.

1. Increase the intensity of your focus. Really try to concentrate more. The more you can focus, the less you will be caught up in other thoughts.
2. Label your thoughts. When a thought comes up, say to yourself, "Now I am having a thought about {subject}." Then bring your attention back to the breath. This might seem like it would be useless, but it really does help.
3. If you are really worried about something and just can't focus, it's okay to discontinue your meditation and come back later when you are less worried.
4. Create a relaxing environment for meditation. Turn down the lights. Light some incense or a scented candle or an "oil burner". Play some very low-key music that isn't too distracting.
5. Try a guided meditation. There are a lot of apps that can provide a little bit of coaching and encouragement during your practice session.
6. Sit for a long time. Sometimes you can just wait out the worrying mind.


### How long should I meditate?

You can start with as little as 5 minutes. Actually, you can even start with as little as three breaths.

Once you can do 5 minutes, you might choose to gradually increase a few minutes at a time. You can then move up to 7 minutes, then 10 minutes, etc.

It is commonly recommended to do 20 minutes a day. All of the benefits discussed in this book can be realized in just 20 minutes of daily practice. Of course, the volume of practice does matter, and more practice does mean more substantial benefits. But 20 minutes a day can produce dramatic results for some people.


### How often should I meditate?

Every day. Meditation only works if you are doing it. And it only continues to work if you continue to do it. It has to become a regular part of your routine, like eating dinner or brushing your teeth. If you start skipping days, you will start to lose momentum. It’s okay to miss a day here or there. But otherwise, you should meditate every day.


### When and where?

I am fan of meditating first thing in the morning. The benefits of meditation are so significant that it deserves to be your first priority for the day. That is why I get my meditation done before anything else. Get up first thing in the morning and meditate.

Some people prefer to meditate in the evening. Personally, I find it almost impossible to stay awake if I try to meditate in the evening. But I am a morning person, so your experience may differ.

You can meditate anywhere you can find a quiet place, but you don’t need total silence. Eventually, you won’t even care if there is noise in the background. Just sit somewhere you won’t be interrupted in any position that is comfortable.


## A Quick Disclaimer

I am going to be making a lot of claims about the benefits of meditation. For convenience, and to avoid writing about myself the whole the time, I will be using the second person pronoun "you". I will make statements like: "you" will experience this, and "you" will experience that. But the reality is that your mileage may vary. "You" are a unique individual, who may not experience meditation the way I have.

But I have been meditating for a lot of years, and I know many other people who have also done a quite a bit of meditation. Everyone I know who has stuck with their practice has experienced similar benefits. So the results are not guaranteed, but they are at least reasonably probable.


## The Benefits

Now that we've got a basic understanding of what we're talking about, let's go over the benefits that you should see from a meditation practice.


### Reduced Reactivity

The first benefit that people typically notice from meditation is that they are less "reactive". By this I mean they are less prone to anger, less irritable, and less likely to react negatively all of a sudden to things they don't like.

Have you ever acted all of a sudden without even realizing it, almost like a reflex? I can certainly remember a few such occasions from my own life. I thought about giving you some personal examples of my own reactivity in the past. But frankly these are embarrassing and painful to recall, and I don't think the concept really needs a lot of explanation. We've all been there.

The important point here is that meditation will make you more in control of your own behavior. You'll be less snappy, less likely to talk back without thinking, more deliberate in choosing your words and actions. This benefit alone can be life changing.

I call this the "first" benefit that people notice, because it's usually just that, the first thing you notice. You do your daily meditation for a few minutes a day. You may or may not find it all that relaxing. But then one day you notice that you have a bit more self control. And it feels really amazing. You are more like the person you want to be. You are no longer getting jerked around by life quite as much. You are less at the mercy of external factors.

You have more self control. Only it's not control like a commander ordering his troops around on a field. It's not oppressive or constraining. Quiet the opposite, in fact. It is liberating. You are more in control, because the part of you that is really "you" is making the decisions. And the "control" you experience does not come from suppressing your reactions. It comes from seeing them in a new light.

Now we come to the point that is kind of hard to explain. You stop reacting, because you see your reactions differently. Let's look at that more closely. Let me write it again. You stop reacting, because you see your reactions differently.

That's kind of a contradiction. In order to see a reaction differently, don't you have to have that reaction? Well, yes, you still have the reaction inside of yourself, but you are less likely to act on it. You experience it differently as it arises, almost like it is happening in slow motion.

This is because you have been meditating day after day. You've been sitting on your cushion and trying to focus on your breath. Some of the time you've been "successful", and you've noticed how relaxing that is. A lot of the time you've been "failing", and you've been watching your mind spin in circles. You've seen how fast the mind works. You've seen it get away from you a thousand times. You've had to bring your mind back from random thoughts and fantasies again and again.

And the more you've done this, the mo;e you've become familiar with all of the little rabbit tricks of your own personality. All of your little hangups and fears and delusions and worries and irritations have been playing out for you in miniature on the back of your eyelids, like a little puppet show inside your own head, except it's not a show, it's you.

And so now, when one of those little puppets gets upset, you realize you are just kind of watching the same puppet show again, and it's just not as interesting. In fact, it's kind of boring. It's just another round of the same thing you've been doing your whole life. And because you are less interested in doing that thing again, you have the opportunity to consider some alternatives. And naturally you take that opportunity, because why wouldn't you, and you do something different for a change, something more carefully considered, something else that you'd really rather do.

This becomes your first taste of "the seeing that frees". [cite Rob Burbea]  You have taken a glimpse into the depths of your own mind, and you have experienced your first taste of liberation. You are no longer so much at the mercy of external events. You are less reactive and more in control. Not only do you know your own mind better, but you have become more skilled at seeing through the illusions and fantasies that your mind regularly generates.

Take a moment and think about how huge that is. How many lives could be changed for the better if they had just had a little less reactivity? How many bad decisions could be averted? We are talking about nothing less than a radical improvement in a person's life. Even one bad decision averted can be life changing.

And think about this on a social level. Imagine how our culture would change if, as a whole, we all became less reactive and more in control of our own destiny.

This one benefit alone is worth the price of admission. But there are other benefits to meditation that are equally if not more profound.


### Better Social Relationships

To be fair, some of the benefits I am going to discuss are closely related to, or even derivative from, reduced reactivity. This includes one of my favorite benefits: better social relationships.

I am sure you can see right away how reduced reactivity results in better social relationships. You are less likely to be snappy and irritable, so you get along better with others. It's not complicated.

Nevertheless, social relationships are so important to mental health and happiness that I felt that this particular category deserved to be given some special discussion.

In addition, there is an effect of meditation that seems to be quite distinct (although not entirely unrelated to) reduced reactivity. And that effect is enhanced empathy.

Meditation helps us to have better empathy for others.

I want to be careful here to make sure that I am clear that I do not just mean compassion in the sense of kindness or gentleness or a propensity for mercy and conciliation. I mean specifically the term "empathy", which means the ability to recognize and be aware of the feelings, thoughts, and experiences of other people.

This is a huge benefit for the other people around you, who have to live with you. But it is also a huge benefit for you. Even if you are entirely self-interested and focused on improving your own life, you still need to cultivate the capacity for empathy. You still need to have the ability to understand people in order to navigate your relationships with them and interact with them effectively. At minimum, you need to know what buttons to push to get the behaviors you want. Empathy is how you figure that out.

Another benefit of empathy is that it makes other people much easier to tolerate. When someone is being obnoxious and you can't understand why, it is very difficult to tolerate that obnoxious behavior. But when someone is being obnoxious and you have an understanding as to why they're doing it, then it makes it a little easier to accept the situation. You will feel less like a victim. You will recognize the suffering that is giving rise to the obnoxious behavior, and you will realize that the person at issue is probably hurting themselves more than they are hurting you. Having the ability to understand what is causing the behavior will also provide valuable clues about how to get it to stop.

Most of us are not completely self interested, though. We care about others, have meaningful personal relationships, and generally want to get on well with other people. Empathy helps us to cultivate deeper, healthier bonds with our family and have more rewarding friendships.

So how does meditation give rise to empathy? Well, as mentioned above, meditation involves a lot of looking within, a lot of introspection. This means that you spend a lot of time examining your own thoughts, impulses, and emotions. You get much better acquainted with who and what you are.
