There are quite a number of books on meditation and its benefits. I would propose to offer one more. Although the literature on meditation is vast, most books are focused on technique. This is quite understandable. If you inform someone about the technique, they will be more likely to obtain the benefits. If you inform them about the benefits, on the other hand, they will be no closer to understanding the technique. Writing about the benefits seems a bit like putting the cart before the horse.

There are also at least two other reason why meditation teachers generally do not talk about the benefits. First, there is the concern that one could create unrealistic expectations. Telling someone what to expect, and how great it is, is a sure way to create disappointment. This is especially true for beginning meditators who have not yet become skilled with the technique.

Second, it's not traditional. Most of the literature of meditation comes from Buddhism. In most Buddhist traditions, it is considered somewhat impolite to talk about one's meditative attainments. It can come across as boastful, and it might be discouraging to others who have not achieved similar experiences. Also, in a monastic community where social status depends at least in part on skill in meditation, talking about meditating attainments can potentially offend one's peers or superiors.

I am not deterred by any of the above considerations. For example, I am not worried about putting the cart before the horse. There are so many books on meditation that, if someone is intrigued by what they find here, they will have plenty of resources to aid them on their journey when they undertake their first steps into meditative practice.

I am also not worried about creating false expectations. Most of the benefits I describe should become apparent for most practitioners. In addition, I have included in this book a candid discussion about the difficulties one is likely to encounter as a beginning practitioner.

I am also not bound by traditional considerations. I do not live in a monastic community. In my world, meditation is not generally viewed as a prestigious activity. It is rather regarded as a somewhat odd and eccentric habit, possibly even a waste of valuable time. Talking about one's meditative attainments in a public sphere is therefore a bit less like boasting and more like self-satire.

In addition, there is nothing in these pages that requires one to be a really advanced or skilled practitioner. Most of the benefits discussed here can be readily experienced by even the most innocent beginners.

I am of the firm belief that if you know what you are looking for, you are more likely to find it. In that respect, learning about the benefits of meditation is not putting the cart before the horse. It is rather providing valuable information to the new or even new practitioner, information they can use to help them make the choice to meditate, rather than pursue any of the thousands of other distractions that modern society is constantly sending their way.
