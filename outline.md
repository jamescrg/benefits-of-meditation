My Definition
Could be called equanimity, anger management, stress reduction
We don’t want to get too hung up on the term “self”. I use self synonymously with “person”. The self is basically the person, the combined body/mind system.
This opens us up to a kind of contradiction, though. If the self is the whole person, then everything the self does is by definition, an action of the self. Thus, the self must always be in control.
Really, self-control is about one part of the mind having more influence than another, one motive prevailing over other motives. It’s about doing what we intellectually or rationally know is more important, rather than what our baser instincts desire.
Psychology Today on Self-Control
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/self-control
“Self-control—or the ability to manage one's impulses, emotions, and behaviors to achieve long-term goals—is what separates humans from the rest of the animal kingdom. Self-control is primarily rooted in the prefrontal cortex—the planning, problem-solving, and decision making center of the brain—which is significantly larger in humans than in other mammals.”
“The richness of nerve connections in the prefrontal cortex enables people to plan, evaluate alternative actions, and ideally avoid doing things they'll later regret, rather than immediately respond to every impulse as it arises.”
Aristotle
Self-control is what you exhibit when, after you have deliberated on the right course of action and have chosen the right thing to do, temptation tries to steer you in another direction and you resist temptation, doing the right thing anyway.
This differs from temperance and intemperance, in that the temperate person doesn’t really suffer from strong temptations to begin with, and the intemperate person doesn’t choose wisely to begin with.
Self-control is a matter of degree
Lack of self-control can be seen as a lapse of knowledge, akin to being asleep, insane, or intoxicated.
Self control without meditation
This is not unique to the mind of a person who meditates. This is a capacity inherent to the way the mind works. A person who meditates has simply exercised this capacity and made it stronger and faster-acting. So you spend less time immersed in the emotion. You pop out of it faster.
We’ve all gotten angry and then later on have calmed down and then looked at the situation differently and revised our opinion, and then felt sheepish about our anger. Meditation allows you to go through this process much faster. Rather than gaining perspective hours or days later, you can gain perspective almost instantly, at the very moment that anger arises.
Meditation changes the way we relate to our emotions. Now, virtually all of our emotions become recognizable as subjective. Rather than thinking, “this person is an asshole”, you are more inclined to think, “I am experiencing anger toward this person.” Rather than thinking, “I am depressed”, you are more inclined to think, “I am generating depression.”
Benefits
Happiness, success, stability, predictability, health and well-being, moral continence
Decision-making
There are a few prerequisites to good decision making. A person generally should be calm and rational. They should consider a variety of different perspectives. They should carefully research the subject matter, and thoroughly analyze the available information. They should consider their objectives, their motives, and their short and long term goals. They should think through all of the various outcomes that could result from one decision or the other, and then choose the scenario that seems to result in the best net outcome.
Meditation is helpful to the decision making process in quite a variety of ways. In general, there are very few down sides to using meditation to enhance one's decision making abilities. It can help focus the mind on the subject matter, reinforce a calm and rational mindset, and help keep the mind open to the various relevant perspectives. These are huge advantages.
How it works
Interruption
In the practice of meditation, we are constantly interrupting the flow of our thoughts, in order to bring attention back to the object of meditation. We get a lot of practice with this, and we become skilled at interrupting our thoughts and redirecting our attention.
Interruption can happen very quickly, in just fractions of a second.
Meditation helps me to recognize the opportunity interrupt the unpleasant flow of thoughts.
If the situation is especially important, I might decline to change the direction of my thoughts. But if I recognize the anger as unproductive and unimportant, then I have the chance to turn my attention elsewhere.
Quote from Wikipedia
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt
In digital computers, an interrupt (sometimes referred to as a trap)[1] is a request for the processor to interrupt currently executing code (when permitted), so that the event can be processed in a timely manner. If the request is accepted, the processor will suspend its current activities, save its state, and execute a function called an interrupt handler (or an interrupt service routine, ISR) to deal with the event. This interruption is often temporary, allowing the software to resume[a] normal activities after the interrupt handler finishes, although the interrupt could instead indicate a fatal error.[2]
Interrupts are commonly used by hardware devices to indicate electronic or physical state changes that require time-sensitive attention. Interrupts are also commonly used to implement computer multitasking, especially in real-time computing. Systems that use interrupts in these ways are said to be interrupt-driven.[3]
Introspection
When we practice meditation, we are engaged in a prolonged act of introspection.
When we sit down on the cushion and close my eyes, we am choosing to forego other forms of mental stimulation.
We forego television, reading, social media, arts and crafts, conversation, physical action, all forms of external stimulation except for the physical sensations of the body and the ambient sounds of our environment.
We are thus brought into direct engagement with my own thoughts, feelings, impulses, urges, perceptions, mental chatter, etc. and our internal voice and narrator.
One thing you notice right away is that your inner voice won't stop talking. It can go on and on for the whole duration of your practice.
But during the moments when your inner voice is quiet, you'll notice a lot of other content. Impulses and urges.
You'll notice impulses and urges. Some of these will be subtle. Some of them will be more acute. And there are a lot of them. Especially the subtle ones. You will have all kinds of subtle urges simmering just beneath the surface of consciousness, coming and going, like little bubbles in a simmering pot.
A lot of these subtle urges will want to move you "off the cushion". Most of the time, you don't notice them because they are so transient, and also because there are larger impulses and desires that are running the show, and also because you are drowning them out with stimulation.
We drown out our inner life with outer stimulation. We don't get to know ourselves. This is especially true when we are full of negative judgments.
I think mediation is especially hard for people who have a lot of negative judgments. They are uncomfortable in their own company, because they need to keep themselves distracted from all of their own negativity. But it is similarly hard for people who have a lot of craving.
This frees up the minds to really experience what is going on internally.
Introspection is not the goal of meditation, it's something that happens along the way.
An analogy that might be helpful here is that of playing a board game. When I play a board game, the object of the game is to win. But the object of the game really isn't the point of the game. The point of the game is to have fun with friends. So while I am working toward accomplishing the object of the game, the point of the game is something that hopefully happens along the way.
In meditation, introspection is not the object of the practice. Nor would I say that it is even the point of the practice. But it is one of the points of the practice. And it is definitely something that happens along the way.
But meditation helps improve introspective awareness, self-awareness.
Introspection happens without meditation, but it happens more intensively during meditation.
We are all capable of introspection. We don’t need to meditate in order to engage in introspection, nor to have introspective self-awareness at least some of the time
There are different types of introspection. And there are different ways of engaging in introspection other than what I am describing here: journaling, for example. Active imagination. Dream analysis and talk therapy.
Introspection may seem trivial, but actually it is very profound.
In order to understand something, you have to observe it.
In order to understand things in the outside world, we have to see or hear them or otherwise perceive them through the senses and make records of our observations.
Likewise, in order to understand things on the inside world, we have to become aware of what is going on internally.
The more we start to understand what is going on internally, the more we become aware of some extraordinary inner influences on our behavior. The more we understand the mental landscape. The less we are lost within ourselves. The less we confuse the inner and the outer world.
Quote from Jung
“I realize that under the circumstances you have described you feel the need to see clearly. But your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Without, everything seems discordant; only within does it coalesce into unity. Who looks outside dreams; who looks inside awakes.” (C.G. Jung Letters, Vol. I, Page 33)
How introspection affects behavior
There is usually a long chain of events between perception and action. If we change the perception, we can change our behavior.
Active versus passive introspection
Introspective attention versus introspective awareness
Self-knowledge versus self-awareness
Self-analysis versus real-time awareness
The difference between intellectual introspection versus sustained meditative introspection
Subjectivity / Acclimation
We am more likely to recognize that this thought or perception is just another manifestation of our mind and personality.
For someone who meditates, however, a strong emotion like anger sets off a kind of inner alarm bell. It sends a strong signal that the mind is being particularly active at that particular moment in time. This triggers a shift in perspective. This shift in perspective is habitual, built up over many hours of practice. Instead of simply having the perception, the mind steps outside of the perception and perceives itself perceiving.
You develop a kind of meta-consciousness. This is a kind of consciousness of consciousness. An awareness of awareness. A way of looking inward at yourself.
This lends my thoughts and perceptions a kind of unreality. I no longer give them so much credit. I no longer invest them with such importance. They no longer define my perspective. Rather, my perspective has shifted. I am aware not only of the subject matter or the content of the thought. I am also aware of the formal characteristics of the thought as a feature of my own mind. I recognize it as a piece of myself, and more importantly I recognize myself as a part of the thought. I realize, “that’s just so like me” to be getting suspicious of my neighbor and territorial about my lawn. I realize that my perception of the situation says just about as much about myself as it does about my neighbor.
It also works by the strengthening of the ability to recognize thoughts as thoughts, rather than just thinking them.
I am still trying to explain how this works. How does meditation help establish self-control? When a strong emotion arises, especially anger, there is a moment of recognition. And in that moment, the ego recognizes the emotion. And in recognizing the emotion, the ego recognizes the source of that emotion as coming from the ego itself. It takes ownership of the emotion. It also identifies the emotion as part of a stream of consciousness, and parses out other aspects of the stream, that surround and support the emotion. So instead of just having the emotion, you have the emotion and you step outside of the emotion and observe it. So part of you is experiencing the emotion, and another part of you interrupts the emotion and observes you experiencing the emotion. In this way, you are able to interrupt the emotion, but you are also able to put it in perspective.
The may way this works is by subjectivization. When you have a strong emotion about something you experience that emotion as the product of your own personality. You are less likely to take it for granted as an objective truth. You are more likely to see it for what it is, a subjective emotional response.
This means you won’t be doing as much projecting. Rather than believing that the world is colored in the way that your value judgments tend to color it, you will now be able to distinguish better between the world as you perceive it and the world as it really is. This is not to say that you will have a firm grasp on the world as it really is, or that you will have some greater knowledge of objective truth, but rather that you will have a greater skepticism with regard to your own value judgments. Instead of being inherent in things, you will realize that they are more so inherent in your own personality.
This means that you take ownership of your emotions. Instead of blaming your emotional responses on other people, you recognize them as your own. Instead of viewing yourself as being triggered by external factors, you realize that you are the one pulling the trigger.
Thoughts are cyclical. Many times, the anger we are experiencing is part of a larger cycle of personality that plays out in small and large ways, and which we experience directly while we are practicing.
We have the same thoughts over and over again. We almost never have a new thought. Everything that we think is a variation of something we have thought before. Our thoughts reproduce and evolve. They replicate themselves, and they change slowly over time. We might think of a thought like the swell of a wave that arises in the mind and passes away. But a wave is not always but generally part of a series of similar waves. Sometimes thoughts like waves reinforce and build on one another, and other times they interfere with one another and die down.
But if we have been meditating, then usually we are going to recognize that thought as something that we have experienced before. That thought is usually similar to other thoughts that we’ve had. It is probably the child of some earlier thought that we’ve already had, a thought that has come up again and again and again, dozens if not hundreds of times. Sometimes, in its earliest form, that thought was very basic and very primitive. Maybe it was nothing more than a vague feeling or impression, difficult to describe. Maybe it’s something we have been actively thinking about for quite some time.
Usually, we are moving so quickly from thought to thought that we have very little time to pay attention to them. Of course we experience our thoughts as a distinct type of experience. We experience them as thoughts. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to distinguish thinking from sensory experience. But usually we have a thought and move on to the next one.
In meditation, however, we are sitting there with our mind focused. A thought comes up. We turn or mind back to the meditation object. The thought stands in isolation from other thoughts. So we get a good hard look at it. So now we have a memory of that experience. Focusing . . . thought . . . focusing. We notice the qualitative difference between the thought and the surrounding context. We start to remember these experiences.
Thus, when we experience anger, we recognize the cycles that we have experienced before. And it becomes impossible not to experience that anger as something other than our own subjective personality at work. We recognize the anger as a product of our own consciousness, as part of our own contribution to the fabric of our experience, as a lens through which we are seeing the world, rather than a necessary consequence of external factors. The anger ceases to be something that someone else makes us feel and it becomes something that we ourselves have created.
But we need not enter into such a debate here. It is sufficient to recognize that that our experience of both the internal and the external worlds is conditioned by society and is a kind of projection of the brain. The point is simply to note that meditation makes the act of projection more apparent to the very person which is doing the projecting. And so you have the potential to disbelieve the illusion that you are creating.
Meditation makes us more skeptical of our own ideas, beliefs, and assumptions. Accordingly, we stand in a better, more nuanced relationship with them. We don’t just buy in.
The way this works is by subjectivization. When you have a strong emotion about something, you experience that emotion as the product of your own personality. You are less likely to take it for granted as an objective truth. You are more likely to see it for what it is, a subjective emotional response.
This means you won’t be doing as much projecting. Rather than believing that the world is colored in the way that your value judgments tend to color it, you will now be able to distinguish better between the world as you perceive it and the world as it really is. This is not to say that you will have some greater knowledge of objective truth, but rather that you will have a greater skepticism with regard to your own value judgments. Instead of being inherent in things, you will realize that they are more so inherent in your own personality.
This means that you take ownership of your emotions. Instead of blaming your emotional responses on other people, you recognize them as your own. Instead of viewing yourself as being triggered by external factors, you realize that you are the one pulling the trigger.
What exactly am I saying here? I am saying that we constantly project our value judgments onto the world around us. When we love someone, we think of them as lovely. When we hate someone, we think of them as hateful. When we are bored with something, we think that it is boring. When we see a painting that we like, we think of it as beautiful. As we move through life, we are constantly painting the world around us with our value judgments. And so we live in a world and experience the world as a place in which those value judgments are welded into the very external reality around us. We don't perceive these feelings as coming from within. We perceive them as bound together with the things without.
When we meditate, we spend a lot of time with our eyes closed, or maybe open just a little bit gazing at something neutral, just watching the currents of the mind as they ebb and flow, surge and swirl around. We watch these value judgment percolate up and bubble around and subside. We get familiar with our own inner patters. We experience the activity of our own inner judgments even while we are sitting still and quiet and nothing much is going on.
And so, when we get up from the cushion and go out into the world, we remain aware of our inner value judgments as inner value judgments, rather than as qualities inherent to things that are being judged. This is a bit paradoxical, because it's almost like there are two different processes running in the mind at the same time. There is the process of making the value judgment, and there is the process of observing the value judgment as a subjective event. And it is this second process, which through meditation becomes increasing automatic and persistent, which interferes with the first process. So that the value judgment we are making stutters and softens even as we are making it.
Transience
We more likely to recognize it as a temporary mental phenomenon that will arise and pass away.
Harmlessness
It is just a thought, just a perception
Dis-identification
May people explain this experience by suggesting that, before you start to meditate, you identify with you emotions, whereas after you have had some practice, you learn not to identify with them. You have the same emotions, but you don’t alter your identity when an emotion arises. So rather than saying, “I am angry”, you are more likely to think in terms of “I am making anger in this situation.” In the original perspective, you are at the mercy of your emotions. In the new perspective, you are the master of them.
De-realization
Habituation
Other Topics
Anger
In general, self control is most noticeable with regard to anger.
Perhaps that is because anger is such a strong emotion that can arise so quickly.
Meditation will make this happen less often. When it does happen, it will be less severe and you will recover more quickly. In addition, you will be less likely to act on your anger.
Anger, like other emotions, is sometimes useful. Sometimes anger gets us good results. Sometimes it gets us good results, because it is a skillful response to the circumstances. Sometimes it gets us good results by sheer luck.
But the more you learn to manage and temper your anger, the more you come to the conclusion that it’s almost never productive. Anger almost never helps us deal with the situation more skillfully. Anger dulls our intelligence and interferes with out ability to understand the complexity of a situation and to fashion an optimal strategy for dealing with it. The more you have the capacity to choose anger or something else, the more you’ll end up choosing something else.
When a person acts on anger, they are more likely to act without careful consideration. They are more likely to make mistakes. They are more likely to have accidents, more likely to take actions that they later regret. Sometimes the consequences are minor. Sometimes the consequences are quite serious. A moment of anger can alter the whole trajectory of a person’s life. Thus, it is very important for a person to moderate their anger. In general, the less anger one experiences, the better.
Emotions
This is true of all emotions. All emotions have the potential to be beneficial. Meditation is not about suppressing our emotions. It is about treating our emotional life somewhat like a garden. Some of the plants in the garden are useful. Some of the plants are not particularly useful. Some of the plants need a lot of care to grow. Others seem to grow on their own without much help. Our job is to protect the useful plants that need care to grow, and to weed out the aggressive plants that aren’t particularly useful.
Irritability
The same thing can be said for irritability, anger’s smaller cousin. Often, things happen that are too small to justify anger, but they are nevertheless irritating. Meditation helps with this too. When irritation does happen, it is less severe, and it goes away more quickly. In addition, a person is less likely less likely to act on their irritability. This again is a significant increase in their quality of life.
Fear / Anxiety
Fear is a little bit different from irritability and anger in terms of how it is affected by a meditation practice. At first, you may not notice that meditation has much effect on fear. Your sense of self-preservation will remain very much intact.
Anxiety is like a little bit of fear.

Disclaimers
There are also at least two other reason why meditation teachers generally do not talk about the benefits. First, there is the concern that one could create unrealistic expectations. Telling someone what to expect, and how great it is, is a sure way to create disappointment. This is especially true for beginning meditators who have not yet become skilled with the technique.
I am not deterred by any of the above considerations. For example, I am not worried about putting the cart before the horse. There are so many books on meditation that, if someone is intrigued by what they find here, they will have plenty of resources to aid them on their journey when they undertake their first steps into meditative practice.
I am also not worried about creating false expectations. Most of the benefits I describe should become apparent for most practitioners. In addition, I have included in this book a candid discussion about the difficulties one is likely to encounter as a beginning practitioner.
