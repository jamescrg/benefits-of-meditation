## Introduction: A Quick Primer on Meditation

There are many benefits to the practice of meditation. These include reduced reactivity, better social relationships, and a greater enjoyment of life, among others. In this book, I discuss these and other benefits at some length. I talk about how meditation brings such benefits about and how much time and effort are needed to start experiencing them. The bottom line is, for most people, meditation is a very worthwhile endeavor. It is one of the best things a person can do for their well-being and general happiness.


### What is meditation?

Simply put, meditation is focusing in the mind. You bring the mind to concentrate on some particular object, and then you keep it there.

Usually, the meditation object is "the breath". This means the physical sensations associated with breathing. Some prefer to focus on the rising and falling of the belly. Other concentrate on the flow of air past the nostrils. Either way, one's attention is brought to bear on a particular physical sensation associated with breathing, and it rests there.

It may help to count your breaths. Breath in and out. That's the first count. Breath in and out again. That's two. And so on, all the way up to 10. Then start over. You are not trying to count to some astronomical number.


### Is meditation difficult?

Meditation is not difficult. The vast majority of people find, however, that keeping the mind on the breath for any length of time is impossible. This is entirely normal and expected. Most people are unable to keep their attention on the breath.

Nevertheless, meditation is not that hard. The beginning practitioner is not expected to focus on the breath for their entire session. They are only expected to try. Maybe they get a few seconds of focus here or there. Even those few seconds are valuable.

In addition, those few seconds of focus are not the only aspect of the exercise that are valuable. The rest of the time is valuable, too. It is important to experience what your mind is like when it is restless and wandering around and doesn't have a compelling task to work on. For this reason, all of the time spent meditating is useful and instructive, even you are not doing a very good job of focusing on the breath, which will be most of the time.

Some people may find the mind-wandering that occurs when they try to meditate to be uncomfortable. They get caught up in their worries and fears. They feel their anxiety level rising. They feel uneasy and find the ordeal unpleasant. And so they discontinue their practice.

There are a few of ways to try to address this problem.

1. Increase the intensity of your focus. Really try to concentrate more. The more you can focus, the less you will be caught up in other thoughts.
2. Label your thoughts. When a thought comes up, say to yourself, "Now I am having a thought about {blank}." Then bring your attention back to the breath. This might seem like it would be useless, but it really does help. You do this over and over again. Each time the mind strays, say "Now I am having a thought about {blank}," and bring it back.
3. If you are really worried about something and just can't focus, it's okay to discontinue your meditation and come back later when you are less worried.
4. Create a relaxing environment for meditation. Turn down the lights. Light some incense or a scented candle or an "oil burner". Ring a little bell when you start and finish your practice. Make it a whole experience.
5. Try a guided meditation. There are a lot of apps that can provide a little bit of coaching and encouragement during your practice session.
6. Sit for a long time. Sometimes you can just wait out the worrying mind.
7. Sit on special meditation cushion, called a "zafu". When you are sitting in a special position, you are constantly reminded by your physical awareness that you are actually supposed to be meditating. This can help to bring back the wandering mind.


### How long should I meditate?

You can start with as little as 5 minutes. Actually, you can even start with as little as three breaths.

Once you can do 5 minutes, you might choose to gradually increase a few minutes at a time. You can then move up to 7 minutes, then 10 minutes, etc.

It is commonly recommended to do 20 minutes a day. All of the benefits discussed in this book can be realized in just 20 minutes of daily practice. Of course, the volume of practice does matter, and more practice does mean more substantial benefits. But 20 minutes a day can produce dramatic results.


### How often should I meditate?

Every day. Meditation only works if you are doing it. And it only continues to work if you continue to do it. It has to become a regular part of your routine, like eating dinner or brushing your teeth. If you start skipping days, you will start to lose momentum. It’s okay to miss a day here or there. But otherwise, you should meditate every day.


### When and where?

It's best to meditate first thing in the morning. The benefits of meditation are so significant that it deserves to be your first priority for the day. Get your meditation done before anything else. Get up first thing in the morning and meditate. You are more alert in the morning than any other time. Once you start to calm down your wandering mind, the next obstacle you will experience is sleepiness. Meditating in the morning really helps with this.

Some people prefer to meditate in the evening. Personally, I find it almost impossible to stay awake if I try to meditate in the evening. But I am a morning person, so your experience may differ.

You can meditate anywhere you can find a quiet place, but you don’t need total silence. Eventually, you won’t even care if there is noise in the background. Just sit somewhere you won’t be interrupted in any position that is comfortable. But it's best to sit on a zafu or a seiza bench.


## A Quick Disclaimer

I am going to be making a lot of claims about the benefits of meditation. For convenience, and to avoid writing about myself the whole the time, I will be using the second person pronoun "you". I will make statements like: "you" will experience this, and "you" will experience that. But the reality is that your mileage may vary. "You" are a unique individual, who may not experience meditation the way I have.

But I have been meditating for a lot of years, and I know many other people who have also done a quite a bit of meditation. I've also read a lot of testimonial books and articles from other people who meditate and write about it. Everyone I know who has stuck with their practice has experienced similar benefits. So the results are not guaranteed, but they are at least somewhat probable, assuming that you stick with the practice for long enough.

Some people notice the benefits right away. Some people have to work at it for awhile. Nearly everybody agrees that they tend to come and go, but they tend to get stronger over time.


## The Benefits

Now that we've got a basic understanding of what we're talking about, let's go over the benefits that you should see from a meditation practice.


### Equanimity

The main benefit of meditation is equanimity.

What is equanimity? It may be a somewhat unfamiliar term for some readers. It's not a term that gets used all that often in everyday conversation. But the meaning is pretty straightforward. A dictionary defines equanimity as "evenness of mind under stress, right disposition, balance".

When you meditate, you cultivate equanimity. You develop more evenness of mind under stress. You develop a more level disposition. You have better balance.

Another source describes equanimity as a state of psychological stability and composure that is  undisturbed by emotions or pain.

I like the term equanimity, because it seems to evoke the image of a ship on the sea. The ship is in good condition. It's not leaning to the left or the right. It's on a even keel. It's not being unbalanced in the waves. Even when the waves come, it just rises and falls without losing its buoyancy.

Equanimity is especially noticeable with regard to anger and irritability. People who meditate generally have an easier time dealing with their anger. They also become less irritable, and better able to control their behavior when they do experience irritation. This is helpful for their social relationships, but it also just makes life more enjoyable.


#### How Meditation Cultivates Equanimity

I probably don't need to sell you on the concept of equanimity. Most people would like a bit more of it. Instead, I want to help you understand how meditation helps to cultivate it. I think that if you understand this, you will be more motivated to dedicate yourself to your meditation practice.
